### Hi mates 👋

🌱 My name is Vlad and I'm blockchain developer. I use Rust and Substrate for already more than 2 years.

🧑‍🎓 I'm a bachelor of Computer engineering, finished the Computer systems and networks education program. Now I'm studying for a master's degree in a field of Cybersecurity.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Subsocial node](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-node/) and [Subsocial Parachain](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-parachain), both based on Substrate.
