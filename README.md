### Hi mates 👋

🌱 My name is Vlad and I'm blockchain developer. I use Rust and Substrate for already more than 3 years.

🧑‍🎓 Education:
- A bachelor of Computer engineering. Finished the "Computer systems and networks" educational program.
- A master of Cybersecurity. Finished the "Administrative management in the field of Cybersecurity" educational program.


🔭 I’m currently working on a few private projects, but mostly on [Subsocial Parachain](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-parachain) based on Substrate.
