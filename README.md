### Hi mates 👋

🌱 My name is Vlad and I'm blockchain developer. I use Rust and Substrate for already more than 3 years.

🧑‍🎓 I'm a bachelor of Computer engineering, finished the Computer systems and networks education program. Now I'm studying for a master's degree in a field of Cybersecurity.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Subsocial Parachain](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-parachain) based on Substrate and a few private projects.
